_**Overview of the Project**_

**Project:** 
            Password Strength Checker

**Objective:** 
            This project aims to develop a user-friendly tool that assesses the strength of a given password, providing instant feedback on its complexity, length, and uniqueness.
            The goal is to educate users on best practices for creating strong and secure passwords, thereby protecting their online accounts from potential threats and cyber attacks. 
            The tool will evaluate passwords based on various criteria, including:

* _Length_      : Minimum and maximum character lengths
* _Complexity_  : Presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special character

The tool will provide a score based on the password's strength, with suggestions for improvement to create a more secure password. 
The project will also include a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily input their password and receive immediate feedback.
